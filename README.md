Create a simple Etch-a-Sketch clone.
  - Start with a 16x16 grid
  - Change the background colour of each cell as the mouse passes over
  - Incorporate a Clear button that will prompt the user for the dimensions of the new grid
  - Render the new grid in the *same* area as was taken by the original 16x16
